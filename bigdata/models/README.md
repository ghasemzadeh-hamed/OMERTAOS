# Router Policy Models

This directory stores metadata and artifacts for router policy models trained via the `weekly_model_train` Airflow DAG.

- `registry.yaml` keeps a chronological list of published model versions.
- `policy.sample.json` demonstrates the payload expected by the control plane reload endpoint.
