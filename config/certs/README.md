# Certificate layout

The repository does not ship long-lived TLS material. During the first
installation the setup tooling generates short-lived **bootstrap certificates**
under `config/certs/bootstrap/` whenever Vault is disabled. These files let the
services start securely until Vault or another certificate authority replaces
them.

Contents:

- `bootstrap/` – Ephemeral CA, server and client certificates generated by
  `scripts/quicksetup.sh`. The generated key material is ignored by Git so the
  artifacts are never committed.
- `templates/` – Reserved for future static templates (currently empty).

After enabling Vault run the platform bootstrap to issue real certificates and
replace the ephemeral ones. The generated files include a `.generated` marker
that records their creation time.
