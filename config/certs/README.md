# Certificate layout

The repository does not ship long-lived TLS material. During the first
installation the setup tooling generates short-lived **bootstrap certificates**
under `config/certs/bootstrap/` whenever Vault is disabled. These files let the
services start securely until Vault or another certificate authority replaces
them.

Contents:

- `bootstrap/` - Ephemeral CA, server and client certificates generated by
  `scripts/quicksetup.sh`. The generated key material is ignored by Git so the
  artifacts are never committed.
- `dev/` - Self-signed certificates produced by `scripts/generate_dev_certs.py`
  for Vault-disabled development and CI environments. The directory only
  contains documentation in Git; keys are ignored.
- `templates/` - Reserved for future static templates (currently empty).

After enabling Vault run the platform bootstrap to issue real certificates and
replace the ephemeral ones. The generated files include a `.generated` marker
that records their creation time.
