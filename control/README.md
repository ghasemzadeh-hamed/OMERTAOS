# aionOS Control Plane

This package provides the control plane services for aionOS. It exposes FastAPI
routes for health checks, memory operations, kernel proposal management, and
model registry interactions that are exercised by the automated tests.

This lightweight README exists so that Poetry can install the project during
continuous integration runs.
