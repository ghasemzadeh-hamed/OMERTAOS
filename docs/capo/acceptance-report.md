# CAPO acceptance report

## R6.12 durable Runtime audit trail — 2026-08-31

Branch: `Radin/capo-r6-validation`

Validated implementation commit: `c5a9246` (`feat(control): persist runtime
audit trails`). The run reused the preserved `omertaos-r6-two` PostgreSQL,
MongoDB, and MinIO volumes but started the base Quickstart with one project
Runtime worker. The previous secondary container remained stopped and was not
removed. The independent pre-existing Runtime remained healthy, so no more
than two Runtime processes were active on the host.

| Gate | Result | Executable evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Static validation | pass | `git diff --check`, Python compile, and targeted Ruff checks exited 0 |
| Targeted audit/migration/scheduler/dispatch/routes | pass after one regression repair | First run reported `17 passed, 1 failed`: same-process cache replay bypassed the scheduler, exposing a missing durable replay event and an incorrect test expectation. Cache replay/conflict events were added; final targeted run reported `19 passed, 3 existing warnings` |
| Transaction rollback | pass | Injected audit persistence failure rolled back the attempt, lease increment, and scheduling decision together |
| Control regression | pass | `77 passed, 3 existing deprecation warnings` |
| Architecture regression | pass | `72 passed, 1 intentionally excluded Structure completion gate` |
| Full Python regression | pass | `222 passed, 2 skipped, 1 intentionally excluded Structure completion gate, 3 warnings` |
| Additive schema | pass | Control startup created `runtime_audit_events` on the preserved PostgreSQL database; migration tests apply the schema twice and no existing table or row is removed |
| Control image build | pass | Only the affected Control image built, sequentially, with locked cached dependencies. Runtime, Gateway, and Console builds were skipped because their code/images were unchanged |
| Resource guard | pass | Available memory was 3.6 GiB before startup, 3.3 GiB during live checks, and 3.6 GiB after shutdown, above the 1 GiB stop threshold |
| Initial Quickstart smoke | pass | The base project passed PostgreSQL, Redis, Runtime, installer, Control, Gateway, Console, automatic registration, dependency, and canonical health-chain checks |
| Tenant rejection evidence | pass after acceptance-input correction | The first intended success used unregistered `tenant-r612` and correctly returned application `ERROR`; durable audit recorded `runtime.schedule/rejected` with `no eligible runtime node`. The persisted node allowlist was preserved rather than overwritten |
| Authenticated canonical task | pass | A unique `tenant-primary` request traversed Console -> Gateway -> Control -> one Runtime and returned status `OK` |
| Durable reconstruction | pass | Admin-authenticated retrieval returned exactly `runtime.schedule`, `runtime.dispatch.start`, and `runtime.dispatch.success`, with matching tenant/task/attempt/node/correlation/trace and retry count 0 |
| Access and data minimization | pass in prototype scope | A different tenant returned an empty event list, no admin credential returned HTTP 403, and the schema/API contained no message, payload, stdout, stderr, idempotency-key, credential, secret, or token field |
| Restart persistence | pass | The same three events remained queryable after normal PostgreSQL and Control container restarts |
| Final Quickstart smoke | pass | The complete read-only smoke probe passed again after the restarts |
| Final shutdown | pass | `docker compose stop` left zero test-project containers running and preserved all three project volumes; no volume deletion command was used. The pre-existing Runtime remained healthy |

The persistence adapter is owned by Control and leaves the shared telemetry
primitive transport-neutral. Scheduling state, decision, and schedule audit
event commit together; dispatch-start persistence is a fail-closed barrier
before Runtime execution; terminal attempt state and outcome audit commit
together. Stored reasons are controlled strings and task/result bodies are not
accepted by the audit schema.

This is prototype-level durable reconstruction, not an immutable security log.
No retention policy, cryptographic integrity chain, external exporter,
independent authorization review, production isolation, native systemd
acceptance, benchmark, scalability result, production readiness, or security
certification is claimed. No credential, cookie, token, secret, or task payload
was printed or recorded.

## R6.11 bounded two-worker Quickstart acceptance — 2026-08-30

Branch: `Radin/capo-r6-validation`

Validated implementation commit: `cd43d8f` (`feat(deploy): add bounded
two-worker quickstart`). The opt-in Compose override used exactly two local
Runtime workers, one sequential Control lifecycle manager, host ports Console
`13100`, Gateway `18180`, loopback Control `18102`, and loopback primary Runtime
`55151` on the isolated `omerta-r6-two-net` network. The secondary Runtime had
no published host port. This run did not modify or delete existing volumes.

| Gate | Result | Executable evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Targeted lifecycle/architecture tests | pass | `25 passed`; JSON list validation, duplicate rejection, sequential probing, dual registration, bounded count, image reuse, and secondary port isolation were covered |
| Control regression | pass | `74 passed, 3 existing deprecation warnings` |
| Native/Quickstart regression | pass | `70 passed` |
| Architecture regression | pass | `72 passed, 1 intentionally excluded Structure completion gate` |
| Full Python regression | pass | `219 passed, 2 skipped, 1 intentionally excluded Structure completion gate, 3 warnings` |
| Compose rendering | pass after command repair | The first render omitted `--env-file` and stopped on required bootstrap variables; the first build omitted `--project-directory .` and stopped on a nonexistent relative context. The corrected canonical render parsed two nodes, reused one Runtime image, exposed no secondary host port, and kept Control loopback-only |
| Sequential image builds | pass with one dependency repair | Control built first. Initial `up --no-build` stopped at create because the project-specific Gateway image was absent; Gateway then built separately and the unchanged stack started. Runtime and Console builds were skipped because their unchanged images were explicitly reused |
| Resource guard | pass | Available memory was 3.9 GiB before startup, 3.4 GiB during live checks, and 3.9 GiB after shutdown; exactly two Runtime workers were running during acceptance |
| Two-node lifecycle | pass | PostgreSQL recorded both trusted endpoints as `healthy` with fresh heartbeats, declared tenant/capability sets, and capacities 1000/512 and 2000/1024; lifecycle probes ran sequentially |
| Full Quickstart smoke | pass twice | Initial and final probes passed service/container health, installer exit, automatic registration, dependencies, and the Console-to-Gateway-to-Control chain; the secondary Runtime binary healthcheck also passed directly |
| Authenticated round-robin | pass | Two unique `tenant-shared` tasks traversed Console -> Gateway -> Control -> Runtime and completed on primary then secondary; audit rows recorded both eligible nodes and trace context |
| Tenant-aware eligibility | pass | `tenant-primary` completed only on primary and `tenant-secondary` only on secondary; audit rows recorded the other node rejected for `tenant` |
| Capability and capacity eligibility | pass | Admin-authenticated scheduler probes selected only secondary for `resource.allocate` and for 1500 CPU millis/800 MiB; primary rejection reasons were `capability` and `capacity` |
| Least-loaded scheduling | pass after test-fixture repair | The first probe left two acceptance leases on secondary and therefore did not create the intended load difference. Those attempts were finished without deletion; the independent rerun made both workers eligible and selected the lower-load secondary |
| Bounded failover | pass | Primary stopped immediately after a fresh heartbeat. Attempt `:0` selected primary and ended `transport_error`; retry `:1` rejected unreachable primary, selected secondary, and completed with retry count 1 of 1 |
| Automatic recovery | pass | Restarting primary restored a fresh healthy heartbeat without manual registration; two subsequent shared tasks completed primary then secondary |
| PostgreSQL restart persistence | pass | Four expected failover/recovery attempt rows remained after a normal PostgreSQL container restart |
| Final shutdown | pass with note | `docker compose stop` left no test-project service running and preserved all three project volumes. Qdrant exited 143 on SIGTERM; other running services exited 0. The pre-existing `compose-runtime-1` was restored healthy |

The node list remains trusted local Control configuration. Runtime receives no
administrator credential and cannot self-authorize tenant eligibility. The
manager enforces a configurable default limit of 2 and hard maximum of 32, and
probes configured workers sequentially on this constrained host.

This acceptance demonstrates bounded local multi-node scheduling and one
worker failover for the allowlisted deterministic echo path. It does not
measure throughput or recovery-time performance and does not establish
scalability, distributed membership, consensus, leader election, lease
fencing, federation, successful Linux isolation, native systemd operation,
production readiness, or security certification. No credential, cookie,
token, or secret value was printed or recorded.

## R6.10 automatic local Runtime lifecycle — 2026-08-30

Branch: `Radin/capo-r6-validation`

Validated implementation commit: `ac39d51` (`feat(deploy): automate
quickstart runtime lifecycle`). The run recreated the isolated Quickstart
containers while preserving the existing volumes, used one Runtime worker, and
used host ports Console `13000`, Gateway `18080`, loopback Control `18002`, and
loopback Runtime `55051` on `omerta-r6-fixed-net`. No manual node registration
or heartbeat command was used.

| Gate | Result | Executable evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle and probe tests | pass | `tests/control/test_runtime_lifecycle.py` reported `6 passed`; coverage includes bounded opt-in configuration, Runtime `QueryMetrics` readiness, invalid JSON rejection, registration, unreachable refusal, and preservation of operator draining |
| Control regression | pass | `70 passed, 3 existing deprecation warnings` |
| Native/Quickstart regression | pass | `70 passed` |
| Architecture regression | pass | `71 passed, 1 intentionally excluded completion gate` |
| Full Python regression | pass | `214 passed, 2 skipped, 1 intentionally excluded completion gate, 3 warnings` |
| Compose rendering | pass | The rendered model selected loopback-only Control publishing and enabled the bounded 10-second local lifecycle interval; no rendered secret values were recorded |
| Control image build | pass | The affected image rebuilt sequentially with locked cached dependencies and exit 0. Runtime, Gateway, and Console images were unchanged and deliberately not rebuilt |
| Resource guard | pass | Available memory was 2.9 GiB before build, 3.4 GiB during final live checks, and 3.8 GiB after shutdown; it remained above the 1 GiB stop threshold |
| Automatic registration | pass | After container recreation, PostgreSQL contained `runtime-quickstart-1` at `runtime:50051`, state `healthy`, capability `terminal.execute`, declared capacity 1000 CPU millis/512 MiB, and a heartbeat newer than 30 seconds |
| Control host-port repair | pass on this host | Publishing Control as `127.0.0.1:18002:8000` returned a valid healthy payload. This removes unnecessary non-loopback exposure and eliminated the reset reproduced with the prior all-interface mapping |
| Full Quickstart smoke | pass twice | Both the initial and post-recovery probes passed container health, installer exit, Runtime binary health, fresh automatic registration, Control/Gateway/Console payloads, dependencies, and the Console-to-Gateway-to-Control health chain |
| Canonical task without manual heartbeat | pass | An authenticated Console API request traversed Gateway, Control, and Runtime and returned HTTP 200, status `OK`, and an exact deterministic echo |
| Runtime outage detection | pass fail-closed | Runtime alone was stopped. After the 30-second freshness threshold, the next authenticated canonical task returned application status `ERROR` with `RUNTIME_NODE_UNAVAILABLE`; PostgreSQL recorded the node `unreachable` with a stale heartbeat |
| Automatic recovery | pass | Starting the same Runtime container caused the Control supervisor to restore a fresh `healthy` heartbeat without a registration call. A new authenticated canonical task returned `OK`, followed by a second complete smoke pass |
| Final shutdown | pass with note | `docker compose stop` exited 0, no project containers remained running, all three project volumes were preserved, and no volume-deletion command was used |

The supervisor is enabled by the Quickstart Compose profile and remains opt-in
for other Control deployments. It probes the configured Runtime gRPC API before
registering or heartbeating, never gives Runtime an administrator credential,
does not let Runtime choose tenant eligibility, refuses to heartbeat a persisted
node whose endpoint differs from trusted Control configuration, and preserves
operator draining. Declared capacity is static local configuration rather than
measured host utilization.

This stage does not demonstrate browser UI interaction, multiple workers,
distributed membership, consensus, leader election, lease fencing, precise
recovery-time performance, native systemd operation, successful Linux
isolation, production readiness, or security certification. Two Python tests
remain skipped by their existing contracts, and the intentional Structure
completion gate was not run. No credential, cookie, token, task payload, or
secret value was printed or recorded.

## R6.9 authenticated canonical execution — 2026-08-30

Branch: `Radin/capo-r6-validation`

Validated repair commit: `cc52204` (`fix(runtime): propagate canonical dispatch
context`). Control, Gateway, and Console images were built sequentially from
that commit. The preserved isolated project used one Runtime worker, host ports
Console `13000`, Gateway `18080`, Control `18001`, and Runtime `55051`, plus the
`omerta-r6-fixed-net` network. The Control port was changed from `18000` while
diagnosing a host publishing failure; both ports exhibited the same reset.

| Gate | Result | Executable evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Context regression tests | pass | Console allowlist `2 passed`; Gateway `4 files, 9 tests passed`; targeted Control transport `7 passed`; Runtime dispatch/transport `14 passed`. Three existing Python deprecation warnings remained |
| Architecture regression | pass after stale-reference repair | The first run reported `69 passed, 1 failed, 1 deselected` because README omitted three current canonical design links. Commit `168840d` restored the references; the targeted test passed and the full rerun reported `70 passed, 1 deselected`. The intentionally red completion gate remained excluded |
| Broader Console regression | pass | `10 files, 22 tests passed` after restoring the locked pnpm `11.13.1` installation; Prisma generation and the direct Next production build exited 0 |
| Service builds | pass | Gateway and direct Console production builds passed; Control, Gateway, and Console container images then built sequentially with exit 0. The unchanged Runtime image was not rebuilt |
| Compose rendering | pass | The isolated Quickstart configuration rendered with the selected images, network, and host ports; this was treated only as static configuration evidence |
| Resource guard | pass | Available memory was 4.0 GiB before startup, 2.8 GiB during final live checks, and 3.0 GiB after shutdown, above the 1 GiB stop threshold |
| Runtime registration and heartbeat | pass, manual | `runtime-r6-1` registered inside the Control network with tenant `tenant-r6` and the single `terminal.execute` capability; a fresh heartbeat reported `healthy` |
| Authenticated canonical task | pass in constrained scope | A real NextAuth session submitted `runtime.echo.v1` through Console `/api/proxy/tasks`; Console, Gateway, Control gRPC, and one Runtime completed it with HTTP 200, application status `OK`, and an exact deterministic echo |
| Tenant and context propagation | pass | PostgreSQL recorded tenant `tenant-r6`, the submitted idempotency key, selected node `runtime-r6-1`, status `completed`, and the submitted W3C traceparent. Runtime audit recorded matching task, tenant, agent, correlation/request, trace, and `authorized`/`completed` outcomes without logging the payload |
| Same-request replay | pass in constrained scope | Repeating the authenticated request with the same idempotency key returned the same task id; PostgreSQL retained exactly one task attempt |
| Service and dependency health | pass internally | Console and Gateway host health returned valid healthy payloads; Gateway reported Redis and Control healthy; Console's system endpoint reported the Console-to-Gateway-to-Control chain healthy; Control's internal HTTP health passed |
| Quickstart smoke | partial failure | PostgreSQL, Redis, Runtime, installer, Control, Gateway, and Console container checks plus Runtime binary health passed. The next host probe failed with exit 1 because Docker's published Control port returned an empty/reset response even after isolated port change and Control recreation; internal and Gateway-to-Control probes remained HTTP 200 |
| Final shutdown | pass with note | `docker compose stop` exited 0, all services stopped, all three project volumes were preserved, and no volume-deletion command was used. Qdrant exited 143 after SIGTERM; the other running services exited 0 |

Failed toolchain attempts were not substituted silently: system Node 18 was
incompatible with the current JavaScript gates; an initial pnpm invocation
could not confirm a module purge without a TTY; the resulting partial module
state lacked Rollup's optional binary; and the pnpm build wrapper's dependency
status/network activity was interrupted with exit 130. The exact locked Console
dependencies were restored without lockfile changes, and the direct underlying
test and build commands subsequently passed. A host `python` invocation also
failed with exit 127 before acceptance orchestration began; the available
`python3` executable ran the unchanged probe successfully. Two diagnostic shell
pipelines produced misleading zero statuses after `curl` failures; neither was
accepted as evidence, and strict independent probes reproduced the failure.

This stage demonstrates one authenticated API request through the complete
canonical service path on one local worker. It does not demonstrate a browser
UI click flow, automatic Runtime registration/heartbeat, multiple workers,
scalability, successful Linux isolation, durable Control audit export,
production readiness, or security certification. The published Control host
port remains an unresolved environment/deployment gate. No credential, cookie,
token, echoed payload, or secret value was printed or recorded.

## R6.8 isolated Quickstart smoke — 2026-08-30

Branch: `Radin/capo-r6-validation`

Validated smoke repair commit:
`0c53328` (`fix(deploy): target isolated quickstart smoke`). The live run reused
the preserved single-worker `omertaos-r6-fixed` containers and images from the
R6.7 acceptance; no image build or dependency installation was performed. This
therefore validates the repaired read-only smoke probe and preserved stack, not
a fresh image build of the current branch.

| Gate | Result | Executable evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Failure reproduction | pass | The previous script rejected `--project-name` with exit 1, so it could not target the isolated acceptance project explicitly |
| Smoke contract regression | pass | `6 passed`; includes mocked project selection, isolated ports, Runtime healthcheck, installer lookup, and invalid-port rejection |
| Native contract regression | pass | `70 passed` |
| Deployment architecture regression | pass | `14 passed, 57 deselected` for the focused Quickstart/deployment/CAPO selection |
| Static validation | pass | Bash syntax, Ruff, `git diff --check`, and sanitized Compose `config --quiet` exited 0 |
| Resource guard | pass | Available memory was 2.2 GiB before startup and 1.9 GiB during live smoke, above the 1 GiB stop threshold |
| Positive isolated smoke | pass | The selected project reported healthy PostgreSQL, Redis, Runtime, Control, Gateway, and Console containers; installer exit 0; Runtime binary health; service payloads; Gateway dependencies; and the Console-to-Gateway-to-Control health chain |
| Wrong-project negative probe | pass | A nonexistent project failed with exit 1 at the missing PostgreSQL container even though the independent default-port `compose-*` stack remained healthy |
| Final shutdown | pass with note | Compose stop exited 0, persistent volumes remained present, Qdrant exited 143 after SIGTERM, and the other R6 containers exited 0 |

The smoke probe remains read-only and does not start, restart, migrate,
bootstrap, or stop services. This stage does not submit a task through Console,
prove the Console-to-Runtime execution path, validate multiple workers, or
change the existing isolation and production-readiness evidence boundaries. No
credential value was printed or recorded.

## R6 Quickstart restart persistence — 2026-08-29

Branch: `codex/capo-r5-runtime-execution`

Validated commit: `5858d3696ad30a6709b60180d2690b13baf1621b`.
The run used one Runtime worker and the preserved `omertaos-r6-fixed` volumes.
It did not build images, run benchmarks, or modify the concurrently running
`compose-*` stack. The isolated acceptance ports were Console `13000`, Gateway
`18080`, Control `18000`, and Runtime `55051`; the Docker network was
`omerta-r6-fixed-net`.

| Gate | Result | Executable evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Resource guard | pass | Available memory was 2.0 GiB before startup, 1.8 GiB at initial health, and 1.7 GiB after restart; it remained above the 1 GiB stop threshold |
| Quickstart startup | pass after two operator-configuration failures | An initial resumed command omitted the isolated network and encountered stale container network metadata; after recreation, the default Runtime port was occupied by the preserved `compose-*` stack. Reapplying the isolated network and port settings started the unchanged images successfully |
| Service health | pass | Console, Gateway, Control, Runtime, PostgreSQL, and Redis were healthy after startup and again after a complete normal stop/start cycle |
| Installer idempotency | pass | The one-shot install container exited 0 on both starts; the user-row count remained `1` |
| Prisma migration persistence | pass | Migration count remained `2`; the sanitized migration-name fingerprint remained `e2e79dd0d4a8b0bed0724ce827291103` before and after restart |
| Volume persistence | pass | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MinIO volumes remained present after the final `docker compose stop` |
| Final shutdown | pass with note | Compose stop exited 0; Qdrant exited 143 after SIGTERM and the other containers exited 0; no volume deletion command was used |

The failed startup attempts are environment/configuration evidence, not service
acceptance. This gate establishes restart persistence and idempotent bootstrap
for the constrained single-worker Quickstart only. It does not establish
multi-worker scalability, Linux isolation, native systemd acceptance,
production readiness, or security certification. No credential value was
printed or recorded.

## R5 constrained Runtime acceptance — 2026-08-28

Branch: `codex/capo-r5-runtime-execution`

Validated deployment/configuration commit:
`0deccc85d6ba5601fb181ce9968b6bdd23e40014`. The Runtime dispatch source is in
`711395a` and `681ff8f`; the build-context checkpoint is `d4ff77a`. Nothing in
this acceptance run was pushed or merged.

The run used one Runtime worker on the recorded 8 GB Linux host. Available
memory remained above 3 GB, services and image builds were executed
sequentially, and the existing `compose-*` stack was preserved. The R5 stack
used separate host ports and the `omerta-r5-net` network.

| Gate | Result | Executable evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture regression | pass | `68 passed, 1 deselected`; the intentionally red completion gate was excluded |
| Full Python regression | pass | `203 passed, 2 skipped, 3 warnings` before live acceptance |
| Runtime image build | pass | Locked release build completed in 17 minutes; cold-build duration is not a performance benchmark |
| Runtime image identity | pass | Image ran as `runtime`; one worker became healthy on loopback port `55051` |
| Control image build | pass after transient network failure | Initial Python base-layer request returned HTTP 403; an independent pull succeeded and the unchanged rebuild passed |
| Gateway image build | blocked | First `npm ci` attempt timed out fetching locked `yargs-parser@21.1.1`; a direct URL probe later returned HTTP 200; the second attempt made no progress for 15 minutes and was stopped with exit 130 |
| Console image/live service | skipped | Gateway image gate blocked the canonical full-stack sequence; no weaker substitute was used |
| Backend startup | partial pass | PostgreSQL, Redis, one Runtime, and Control were healthy; Qdrant and MinIO were running but have no explicit Compose readiness probe |
| Control health | pass | `/health` and `/v1/health` returned `{"status":"ok","service":"control"}` on isolated host port `18000` |
| Node registration and heartbeat | pass | `runtime-r5-1` registered with `terminal.execute`, tenant `tenant-r5`, then accepted a heartbeat |
| Worker failure detection | pass in constrained scope | A heartbeat older than the 30-second threshold changed the node to `unreachable` and dispatch failed closed with `RUNTIME_NODE_UNAVAILABLE` |
| Allowlisted execution | pass | Fresh heartbeat plus gRPC Submit selected `runtime-r5-1`; `runtime.echo.v1` returned exit code 0 and `r5-audit-ok\n` |
| Context/audit propagation | pass at Runtime log boundary | Tenant, task, attempt, request, trace, actor, and authorized/completed outcomes were logged; the echoed payload was not logged |
| In-process idempotency | pass | Identical replay returned `idempotent_replay=true`; Runtime audit-event count did not increase |
| Post-restart idempotency | pass fail-closed | After normal Control restart, replay returned `RUNTIME_RESULT_REPLAY_UNAVAILABLE`; Runtime did not execute it again |
| PostgreSQL persistence | pass | A non-sensitive probe row remained readable after normal PostgreSQL restart |
| Shutdown and volume preservation | pass with note | `docker compose stop` preserved `omertaos_postgres-data` and `omertaos_minio-data`; Qdrant reported exit 143 after SIGTERM while the other R5 services exited 0 |
| Full canonical request path | blocked | Current Gateway image was unavailable, so Console -> Gateway -> Control -> Runtime was not claimed |

Runtime audit evidence required an acceptance-only Compose override setting
`RUST_LOG=info`; the host exports `RUST_LOG=warn`. Control's `emit_audit`
primitive still returns only an in-memory entry and has no durable exporter.
Successful `lite`-profile command execution is not evidence of completed Linux
namespace/seccomp isolation, production readiness, security certification, or
multi-worker scalability.

## R3 current reconciliation — 2026-08-10

Official branch `CAPO` is synchronized at evidence commit
`91921367cdfa600abb91710f7d699a183af800fa`. The current lockfiles are tracked:

| Lockfile | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `runtime-daemon/Cargo.lock` | `9C7EBC387FEF54CB7C2BBC70F96EA2DDF690F7636D18175FA251B96D5D5433F6` |
| `gateway/package-lock.json` | `CECAD9E18FB37754EBDF9CAC078BDC0A10CFE939365651CEB84160746866D55F` |
| `console/pnpm-lock.yaml` | `98FCA5264683D58F5274C14A62971FE56679AC7AD0C3A61C49722CFB0D4555B1` |

CI run [`31358631289`](https://github.com/Hamedghz/OMERTAOS/actions/runs/31358631289)
passed architecture, lint, all service builds, Python and locked Cargo tests,
the locked Runtime release build, integration, security, seven image builds and
six architecture-independent checks. The remaining emulated arm64 Console image
job stayed in progress for more than three hours. R3 moves arm64 image builds to
the native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner and retains the locked Linux Runtime binary
plus its SHA-256 as a CI artifact.

Current Gate status:

| Gate | Status | Current evidence |
|---|---|---|
| S2 Core Migration | passed | Four service builds plus locked Runtime test/release build |
| S3 Supporting Migration | passed | 63 architecture tests and deterministic retired-root guards |
| S5 Legacy Retirement | passed (repository scope) | Explicit approval, absent retired roots, no executable dependencies |
| S6 Architecture Validation | passed | Full Python and architecture suites plus CI boundaries |
| Gate R | pending | Requires the R3 commit to be clean, pushed, fully green and architecture-complete |
| Native live acceptance | pending | No current Ubuntu/systemd reboot/smoke/update/rollback/restore evidence |
| Docker live acceptance | pending | Image build is not running-stack smoke/parity evidence |

Date: 2026-07-12 (Asia/Tehran)

Branch: `capo`

Baseline: `b4021a4327d63b8db0c0e0f87267dec28907cb36`

Phase 6 head reviewed: `d4e96723b5b6341af5c3b4c899d9fdaca2054331`

## Decision

The seven-phase CAPO implementation is **conditionally accepted for human
review and Linux-host validation**. Static contracts, configuration rendering,
application entrypoint checks, Gateway/Console builds, and the verified recovery
baseline pass. Production use, permanent legacy-path retirement, merge, and
deployment are not accepted by this report.

Native systemd acceptance remains pending on the intended Debian/Ubuntu SSD
host. Running Docker Quickstart acceptance also remains pending because the
local Docker daemon did not respond during Phases 6 and 7. These two gates are
independent and neither may be inferred from static validation.

## Delivered scope

- Verified external Git/source backup and reconstruction map.
- Non-secret CAPO environment and idempotency/security contract.
- Debian/Ubuntu, PostgreSQL, and Redis installers with dry-run behavior.
- Canonical Control, Gateway, Console, and Runtime build/install scripts.
- Four non-root systemd services, aggregate target, and lifecycle scripts.
- Read-only Native/Quickstart smoke checks, contract tests, troubleshooting,
  canonical backup verification, and immutable release rollback.

Across Phases 1–6, CAPO added 29 tracked files with 1,529 lines relative to the
baseline. No existing source, schema, table, data, legacy path, or public API was
removed or moved.

## Evidence

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backup SHA-256 and Git bundle | pass | Three hashes match; bundle reports complete history |
| CAPO Bash syntax and `--help` | pass | All reviewed scripts via Git Bash |
| CAPO PowerShell contracts | pass | Ports, env, systemd hardening, rollback, forbidden commands |
| Quickstart/Local Compose rendering | pass | Both `config --quiet` checks |
| Architecture tests | pass | `14 passed in 0.95s` in final review |
| Control import | pass | `control.app.main:app` |
| Gateway TypeScript build | pass | `tsc -p tsconfig.json` |
| Console production build | pass with warnings | Missing local Prisma generation/DB URL; stale browser data |
| Runtime metadata | pass | Cargo manifest resolves without dependency download |
| Runtime release build | blocked | `index.crates.io:443` unavailable after retries |
| Full Python regression | blocked by legacy collection | 11 import errors for removed `os.control`, `os.kernel`, `aion`, and CLI paths |
| Native Linux smoke | pending | Requires intended Linux SSD/systemd host |
| Running Quickstart smoke | pending | Docker daemon did not respond; stack was not mutated |

No coverage report was generated because CAPO changes deployment assets and
documentation rather than application runtime code.

## Security and data review

- Services run as the dedicated non-login `omertaos` account and include
  `NoNewPrivileges` and `PrivateTmp`.
- Real secrets remain outside Git in `/etc/omertaos/omertaos.env`.
- PostgreSQL and Redis are required; optional stores default disabled.
- Static scanning found no executable destructive disk, Git move/removal,
  `DROP`, or `TRUNCATE` command in CAPO assets.
- Rollback preserves source, configuration, accounts, databases, volumes, and
  persistent state.

## Open acceptance gates

1. Run installers twice on a disposable Debian/Ubuntu SSD host and confirm the
   second execution is idempotent.
2. Run `first-boot.sh --version VERSION --backup PATH --start`, Native smoke,
   journald review, reboot recovery, stop/start, update, and rollback
   preview/execute with an operator present.
3. Start Quickstart, run its smoke test, verify Console → Gateway → Control →
   Runtime, and stop it without deleting volumes.
4. Restore the external backup in an isolated environment and reconcile the
   resulting commit and data checks.
5. Resolve or formally quarantine the legacy Python tests before treating the
   repository-wide regression suite as green.

Until all relevant gates pass, the permanent-deletion gate stays closed and
human review is required before merge or any production use.
