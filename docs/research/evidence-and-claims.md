# Evidence and claims

**Document role:** current claim ledger for academic and technical review.

## Evidence levels

| Level | Definition |
|---|---|
| **E1 — repository-verified** | The claim is checked by an executable repository test or deterministic static gate. |
| **E2 — implemented prototype** | Relevant source and targeted checks exist, but the complete deployment or acceptance path has not been demonstrated. |
| **E3 — design target** | The repository documents the behavior, but implementation or empirical validation is incomplete. |
| **E0 — unsupported** | No adequate evidence is present; the statement must not be presented as a result. |

## Claim ledger

| Claim | Level | Repository evidence | Boundary of the claim |
|---|---|---|---|
| The canonical request path is Console -> Gateway -> Control -> Runtime. | E1 | `tests/architecture/test_layer_boundaries.py`, `test_canonical_contract.py`, `STRUCTURE.md` | Proves repository dependencies and selected routes, not network segmentation in a deployed cluster. |
| Canonical top-level ownership replaced migration-era duplicate roots. | E1 | `tests/architecture/test_target_structure.py`, Structure S6 report | Applies to the evaluated tree/commit; historical material remains under migration evidence. |
| Control does not directly execute host subprocesses. | E1 | `tests/architecture/test_subprocess_boundaries.py` | Static and targeted source scope; not a formal whole-program proof. |
| Runtime denies execution when required sandbox backends are unavailable. | E2 | `runtime-daemon/src/sandbox/*.rs`, `runtime-daemon/tests/migration_contract.rs` | Demonstrates fail-closed stubs; it does not demonstrate successful isolated execution. |
| Runtime checks named capabilities before selected RPC operations. | E2 | `runtime-daemon/src/security/capability.rs`, `server.rs` | Current signature validation is minimal and does not establish a production cryptographic grant protocol. |
| Gateway and Control form separate transport/orchestration services with an authenticated local HTTP service boundary for current administrative compatibility routes. | E2 | R6.12.2 commit `db32030`; `gateway/src/routes/config.ts`, `gateway/src/routes/network.ts`, `control/app/service_auth.py`; Gateway/Control tests and constrained live acceptance | Configuration, Network, and Runtime admin routes reject role-only headers and require the configured Gateway service token; Network roles affect view filtering only after service authentication. This is a shared-secret local prototype boundary, not mTLS, workload identity, network segmentation, independent authorization review, or production certification. |
| Control contains a minimal Runtime node registry, local lifecycle supervisor, and scheduler prototype. | E2 | `control/scheduling/`, `control/app/runtime_nodes/`, commits `076db60` and `edde9b0`, scheduler/lifecycle/PostgreSQL concurrency tests, and R5 through R6.14 constrained acceptance reports | Demonstrates single-Control registration, bounded sequential probe-driven heartbeat for two local workers, stale-worker detection, automatic local recovery, tenant/capability/capacity eligibility, round-robin/least-loaded selection, bounded retry, tenant-scoped attempt replay, trusted-config reconciliation, PostgreSQL-serialized attempt identity, atomic worker-capacity reservation/release, bounded execution-lease expiry, and lifecycle-driven capacity reclamation. One constrained live worker rejected missing and repeated lease metadata. Declared capacity remains static local configuration. The lease token is not caller authentication, the Runtime fence is process-local, and this does not prove cancellation of admitted work, durable fencing across Runtime restart, multi-Control consistency, distributed membership, consensus, leader failover, or multi-worker scalability. |
| Control persists a tenant-scoped Runtime scheduling and dispatch trail. | E2 | R6.12 commit `c5a9246`; R6.12.1 commits `78b02b1` and `b0181ee`; `control/audit/`; Control audit/migration/dispatch tests; `docs/capo/acceptance-report.md` | A constrained live task produced durable schedule/start/success events with actor, task, attempt, node, correlation, trace, outcome, and retry metadata; tenant mismatch returned no events, a role-only request returned 403, and configured service-token access succeeded. Bounded cursor pagination was exercised across two pages, and earlier events survived PostgreSQL and Control restarts. The table is not cryptographically tamper-evident, independently exported, retention-managed, or evidence of production authorization. |
| The allowlisted `runtime.echo.v1` path can execute through the authenticated canonical service path on one or two constrained local Runtime workers. | E2 | R5 commits `711395a`, `681ff8f`; R6.9 commit `cc52204`; R6.10 commit `ac39d51`; R6.11 commit `cd43d8f`; R6.12 commit `c5a9246`; `docs/capo/acceptance-report.md` | Constrained live runs demonstrated authenticated Console API -> Gateway -> Control -> Runtime traversal, tenant/correlation/trace/idempotency propagation, same-request replay, durable tenant-scoped Control audit for one successful task, local two-worker round-robin and tenant eligibility, one bounded failover retry, probe-driven recovery, and fail-closed post-restart replay. Browser UI traversal, independent audit export, production isolation, broader commands, and scalability remain unproven. |
| The system provides complete Linux namespace, mount, seccomp, and process isolation. | E0 | Backends currently return errors | Must not be claimed until implementation and negative/escape testing pass on a compatible Linux host. |
| OMERTAOS provides distributed membership, scheduling, and federation. | E0 | Cluster documents plus minimal node-registration/resource-report stubs | These are design topics, not a working distributed subsystem. |
| OMERTAOS has measured scalability or lower latency than alternatives. | E0 | Benchmark blueprint only | No controlled quantitative results are committed. |
| OMERTAOS is security-certified, formally verified, or penetration-tested. | E0 | No certification or independent report | Architecture and CI scans are not certification. |
| Native Linux/systemd and running Quickstart paths have passed production acceptance. | E0 | CAPO acceptance report records pending gates | Static checks and Compose rendering are insufficient. |

## Acceptable wording

Use:

- “the architecture tests reject selected bypass paths”;
- “the Runtime prototype currently fails closed when isolation backends are
  unavailable”;
- “the repository defines a benchmark protocol”;
- “one constrained local worker executed the allowlisted Runtime echo path”;
- “a constrained local Runtime task produced a durable tenant-scoped Control
  audit trail.”

Do not use without new evidence:

- “provably secure”;
- “production-ready”;
- “fully isolated”;
- “horizontally scalable”;
- “low latency” or “high throughput”;
- “validated in real-world deployments.”

## Evidence provenance

Results should record:

- repository URL and exact commit SHA;
- branch only as navigation context, not as a stable identifier;
- operating system, architecture, toolchain, and dependency lock state;
- exact command and exit code;
- test counts, skipped tests, warnings, and unavailable external services;
- generated logs or reports with secrets removed.

The dated migration and CAPO reports are useful provenance but may become stale.
Current reviewers should rerun the commands in
[Reproducibility](reproducibility.md).
