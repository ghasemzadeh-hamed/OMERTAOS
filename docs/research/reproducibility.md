# Reproducibility protocol

**Document role:** executable validation procedure.

## Artifact identification

Record the immutable commit before testing:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
```

Use a clean checkout of the `CAPO` branch. A branch name alone is not a
reproducible artifact because it can move.

## Reference toolchains

| Area | Reference |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.11; project metadata allows 3.11–3.12 |
| Gateway/Console | Node.js 20; Console declares pnpm 11 |
| Runtime | Rust stable |
| Containers | Docker Engine with Compose v2 |
| Native acceptance | Compatible Linux host with systemd |

Pin dependency lockfiles and report any dependency-resolution failure. Do not
substitute a static check for a blocked compilation or runtime test.

## Validation sequence

### 1. Repository architecture

```bash
python -m pytest tests/architecture -q
```

This checks canonical ownership and selected dependency boundaries. It does not
start services or test operating-system isolation.

### 2. Gateway

```bash
npm ci --prefix gateway
npm run build --prefix gateway
npm test --prefix gateway
```

Capture build/test exit codes and the number of executed tests. Network access
may be required for a fresh dependency install.

### 3. Console

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm --dir console install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir console test -- --config vitest.config.mts
pnpm --dir console build
```

The production build validates compilation and route generation. Browser,
authentication, RTL, and live-stream behavior require separate end-to-end
evidence.

### 4. Runtime

```bash
cargo fmt --check --manifest-path runtime-daemon/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path runtime-daemon/Cargo.toml --all-targets
```

Current negative-path tests expect unavailable isolation backends to fail
closed. A passing test suite is not evidence of successful namespace/seccomp
isolation until those backends and host-level escape tests are implemented.

### 5. Deployment model

```bash
docker compose --project-directory . -f deploy/docker/compose/quickstart.yml config
```

Compose rendering checks syntax and interpolation only. A running acceptance
test must separately establish health, request flow, persistence, cleanup,
rollback, and secret handling.

## Experimental benchmark blueprint

For each architecture variant and workload:

1. warm dependencies and record hardware/software state;
2. run an explicit warm-up period;
3. execute enough independent repetitions for confidence intervals;
4. report median, p95, p99, throughput, errors, queue time, and resource use;
5. separate external model/tool time from OMERTAOS governance overhead;
6. randomize run order or explain why it is fixed;
7. publish workload definitions, seeds, raw observations, and analysis code.

At minimum, include short tool calls, long model calls, concurrent multi-tenant
loads, denied requests, cancellation, dependency failure, and worker loss.

Never omit a failed or skipped gate from a summary. Redact credentials, tokens,
prompts containing personal data, and infrastructure secrets.
